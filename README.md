# Hacktoberfest 2019 Angular Resources

> https://timdeschryver.github.io/hacktoberfest-2019-angular/

Add your favorite [Angular](https://angular.io/) resource from the year!
This can be a resource that you enjoyed, learned from, or came back to the most frequent.

Add your resource at [resources.json](https://github.com/timdeschryver/hacktoberfest-2019-angular/blob/master/src/assets/resources.json), this can be done directly via the GitHub UI in the browser or you can also fork and clone this project locally.

Before adding your resource at [resources.json](https://github.com/timdeschryver/hacktoberfest-2019-angular/blob/master/src/assets/resources.json), please search whether the title of the resource already exists in the file to avoid duplicates. Please make this check before submitting a Pull Request.

After your resource is added, do not forget to create a Pull Request.
Once the Pull Request is merged, your resource will be visible!

> If this is your first time I can recommend [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) by [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/).

As an example, you can take a look at how I [added my resource](https://github.com/timdeschryver/hacktoberfest-2019-angular/commit/88548346a575869fb52968c60feeb0e31d75fb18).

## The structure of a resource

A resource has to look a certain way, here below you can find an example:

```json
{
  "title": "The title",
  "description": "A short description",
  "author": {
    "name": "The author's name",
    "profile": "A link to the author's bio - this is optional"
  },
  "url": "The url to the resource",
  "category": "The category of the resource this can be one of the following, library, article, talk, or recording",
  "contributor": {
    "name": "Your name",
    "profile": "A link to your bio - this is optional"
  }
}
```

Or take a look at the [schema](https://github.com/timdeschryver/hacktoberfest-2019-angular/blob/master/src/assets/resources-schema.json).

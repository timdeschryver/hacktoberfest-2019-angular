# Hacktoberfest 2019 Angular Resources

> https://timdeschryver.github.io/hacktoberfest-2019-angular/

Add your favorite [Angular](https://angular.io/) resource from the year!
This can be a resource that you enjoyed, learned from, or came back to the most frequent.

Add your resource at [resources.json](https://github.com/timdeschryver/hacktoberfest-2019-angular/blob/master/src/assets/resources.json), this can be done directly via the GitHub UI in the browser or you can also fork and clone this project locally.

After your resource is added, do not forget to create a Pull Request.
Once the Pull Request is merged, your resource will be visible!

> If this is your first time I can recommend [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) by [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/).

As an example, you can take a look at how I [added my resource](https://github.com/timdeschryver/hacktoberfest-2019-angular/commit/88548346a575869fb52968c60feeb0e31d75fb18).

## The structure of a resource

A resource has to look a certain way, here below you can find an example:

```json
{
  "title": "The title",
  "description": "A short description",
  "author": {
    "name": "The author's name",
    "profile": "A link to the author's bio - this is optional"
  },
  "url": "The url to the resource",
  "category": "The category of the resource this can be one of the following, library, article, or talk",
  "contributor": {
    "name": "Your name",
    "profile": "A link to your bio - this is optional"
  }
}
```

Or take a look at the [schema](https://github.com/timdeschryver/hacktoberfest-2019-angular/blob/master/src/assets/resources-schema.json).
